# Idle Galactic Miner

An idle/incremental web game inspired by Cookie Clicker — click to earn resources, automate production, and scale up your empire while the game runs in the background. Built as a personal project to explore game logic, UI design, and to progress my learning of the JavaScript programming language.

> ⚠️ This game is still in early development. Expect bugs, placeholders, and features in progress!

The current version of the game is avalable via cloning the repo.

When the game reaches an appropriate stage early versions will be deployed.
