# Idle Game (Working Title)

An idle/incremental web game inspired by Cookie Clicker — click to earn resources, automate production, and scale up your empire while the game runs in the background. Built as a personal project to explore game logic, UI design, and to progress my learning of the JavaScript programming language.

> ⚠️ This game is still in early development. Expect bugs, placeholders, and features in progress!
