# Idle Galactic Miner

**Idle Galactic Miner** is a space-themed incremental/idle game where you mine asteroids, automate production, and scale your intergalactic ore empire — even while you're AFK. Inspired by *Cookie Clicker*, but set among the stars.

This is a personal project built to improve my understanding of **JavaScript**, **game logic**, and **UI layout** through practical development.

> ⚠️ Still in early development — features, art, and balancing are all a work-in-progress!

The current version of the game is avalable via cloning the repo.

When the game reaches an appropriate stage early versions will be deployed.
